- There are 197 Women in the game, notibly 2 Champions (You must enter Naboris and Ruta to talk to them), Jerrin in Akkala Tech Lab (who requires you get Camera), 8 Yiga Assassins (who require you talk to Impa first), 4 Great Fairies (who must be paid), .road(13 Road NPCs) (more on them below), and 3 Tarrey Town Residents (requiring you to complete From The Ground Up partially up to Fyson the Rito).

- .link([NPC info]https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GS5DRdfnNnsczeg-N-iR-6Is9yeAdsRwT4CyDZbdq5U/edit#gid=1594284283) from 100% resources, helpful for certain NPCs but not for every woman

- .road(Road NPCs are labelled like this in the route). They spawn anywhere along their road at any time of day and their specific position is random. They are routed in a way that expects you may travel the entire road to find them. If you see one, do not turn the camera away as this has caused them to despawn in my testing. They can also be at their destination/origin town or stable. They will be the most challenging and frustrating part of this run because they rely on pure RNG.
