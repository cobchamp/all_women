- There are 192 Women in the game, notibly 2 Champions (You must enter Naboris and Ruta to talk to them), Jerrin in Akkala Tech Lab (who requires you get Camera), 4 Great Fairies (who must be paid), .road(13 Road NPCs) (more on them below), and 3 Tarrey Town Residents (requiring you to complete From The Ground Up partially up to Fyson the Rito).

- .link([NPC info]https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GS5DRdfnNnsczeg-N-iR-6Is9yeAdsRwT4CyDZbdq5U/edit#gid=1594284283) from 100% resources, helpful for certain NPCs but not for every woman

- .road(Road NPCs are labelled like this in the route). They will be the most time-consuming and frustrating part of this run because they rely on pure RNG. Spawn rates are fairly low and inconsistent along roads, ~5-20%; higher and more consistent near the origin/destination areas (towns/stables), ~15-20%; and at times as high as ~30% when combining these conditions (on a road, in a town/stable) possibly influenced by whether the NPC's dialog is especially relevant to the area. The route suggests following along roads for some sections to increase chances of lucky spawns, but there is always a suggested spot to save and cycle reloading to farm their spawns. When reloading, it may be helpful to move around a little on the road, exiting and re-entering the boundary of the town/stable. There are .link([Road NPC info cards]https://github.com/cobchamp/all_women/tree/main/infocards) provided in the route for each of these NPCs spawn techniques.
