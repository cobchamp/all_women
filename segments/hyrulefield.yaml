  - WB north to tree, use stump for step-up to BLSS to Benny's hill:
      notes:
        - be quick because these Lizalfos are annoying
        - aim for the road between the hills and then steer west

  - WB south to stump korok and BLSS to .place(Lake Hylia):
      notes: toward east post ruins and then directly south following the road past the enemy camp - this BLSS does not have clearance past bridge of hylia. this is tricky to steer through here
