# All Women

A proposed Breath of the Wild Category Extension Speedrun

## Rules

- Runs must start from New Game.
- Timing starts when gaining control of Link.
- You must talk to [all 192 Women in Hyrule](women.txt) with a unique name (Yiga "Travelers" disguised as women count only once). Women are NPCs who are identified as women (with She/Her pronouns in English), are presenting themselves as a woman, or have subjectively been decided fit this criteria in the case of any ambiguity in their physical appearance or dialog _(check the list)_.
- Talking to an NPC is defined as:
  - Their unique name appears as the speaker on any dialog box, as the label in the top-left.
  - They have spoken voice acting in cutscenes and are speaking directly to Link in the present, either in his mind or face-to-face. Dialog spoken in a memory of flashback cutscene is not counted.
  - Interacting with the "Goddess" (Hylia) via a Goddess Statue.
- Timing ends when gaining control of Link after the dialog closes (you must close the final dialog)
