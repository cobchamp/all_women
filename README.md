# All Women

A proposed Breath of the Wild Category Extension Speedrun

## Rules

- Runs must start from New Game.
- Timing starts when gaining control of Link.
- You must talk to [all 188 Women in Hyrule](women.txt) with a unique name on a dialog box. Check the list for clarification on who is included as a goal.
- Timing ends when gaining control of Link after the dialog closes (you must close the final dialog)

Check [BOTW Category Extensions](https://speedrun.com/botw-extension) for general game rules, amiibo rules, etc.

## Route

The current version of the complete route can be viewed on Celer Routing Tool:
